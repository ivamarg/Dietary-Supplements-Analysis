							<p class="fz-16">The idea behind dietary supplements is to deliver nutrients that may
								not be consumed in sufficient quantities. When consuming a healthy diet and purchasing
								a reliable product, many dietary supplements have been shown to be effective and very
								beneficial to health.</p>
							<p class="fz-16">The changing lifestyles and increasing disposable incomes are the
								key factors for the rising demand for dietary supplements. Dietary supplements
								are widely available in drug stores, grocery stores, fitness centers, and online.
								Manufacturers offer a wide variety of supplements to help improve the health.
								Dietary supplements can be vitamins, minerals, amino acids, fatty acids, and other
								substances delivered in the form of tablets, capsules, liquid, etc.</p>

							<p class="fz-16">Supplement research based on data from the iHerb.com online store
								analyzes the popularity and effectiveness of vitamins, minerals, amino acids, fats and
								natural dietary supplements. In addition, the work contains an independent analysis
								of well-known brands, the cost and quality of their products. The project was created
								with the aim of improving education in the field of nutrition and health.</p>
							<p class="fz-16">The work consists of several stages: obtaining data by parsing data from
								the site iHerb.com, processing data, applying descriptive and statistical analysis to
								data, building hypotheses, visualizing results. Technologies used: BeautifulSoup,
								requests, pandas, scipy, D3.js. </p>
							<p class="fz-16">This page is a form for displaying the results of research data based on
								various graphs. To build the graphs, several datasets were used, obtained from a common
								set of raw data after parsing the iHerb data. The initial data contains the ID of the
								product, the name of its type, the name of its category (subspecies), the full name on
								the site, the brand name, rating, number of reviews, price, link to the product page.
								As a filter, the condition of the product release form is used: only capsules and
								tablets. It also excluded new products that do not yet have a rating or reviews on the
								site. For a complete analysis, items without a specified price were also excluded.</p>

							<p class="fz-16">The bubble chart helps you analyze the price,
								popularity, and rating of nutritional supplements. The bubble chart reflects
								the type and closeness of the relationship between variables, helps to see the
								correlation between values. Thus, it is possible to display three-dimensional
								information on one flat diagram. An additional informational load is also carried by
								the color, which reflects belonging to a certain type of supplements (vitamins,
								minerals, amino acids, fish oil & omegas, greens & superfoods).</p>
							<p class="fz-16">The data contains information on the mean price, mean rating, and mean
								popularity of each category of the five types of nutritional supplements.
								The horizontal X-axis shows the mean price of each category of a certain
								type of supplement. The vertical y-axis shows the mean rating of each category
								for a particular type of supplement. The size (diameter or area) of each
								bubble is proportional to the mean popularity of each category for a particular
								type of supplement based on the number of reviews.</p>
							<p class="fz-16">The graph is interactive. When you hover over the name of the type of
								nutritional supplements on the right, the bubbles (categories) of only the selected
								type of nutritional supplements will be highlighted on the bubble chart. When you hover
								over the bubbles themselves, a tooltip appears with the category name,
								mean price, and mean rating.</p>
							<p class="fz-16">From this visualization, insights can be drawn to help you better
								understand how the supplement market works. The most highly rated category is a
								fruit blends from the price segment under 1000 rubles. The lowest rated category is
								acai, also from the price segment up to 1000 rubles. It is interesting to note that
								the "best" category is from the least popular categories, and the "worst" from the most
								popular ones, although they are in the same price segment. In general, vitamins have a
								higher rating (rating > 4.5), while greens & superfoods and amino acids have a lower
								rating (rating < 4.5). Most dietary supplements are rated in the region of 4.5. It is
								difficult to draw conclusions about the correlation between price and rating.</p>
							<p class="fz-16">The cheapest supplement category is copper. And the expensive category
								is krill oil. Moreover, their rating differs significantly among themselves. The cheap
								category is more highly rated than the expensive one and is less popular than the
								expensive one. It is also interesting to note that the vitamin complex is much more
								expensive than the individual vitamins. In general, almost all types of supplements
								are in the lower price segment (average price < 2000 rubles), except for fish oils &
								omegas (average price > 2000 rubles). Most supplements have a price tag of
								less than RUB 2,000. </p>
							<p class="fz-16">Thus, the bubble chart showed us a weak relationship between price and
								rating. The diagram allowed us to establish that the average price of all food
								additives is less than 2000 rubles, and the average rating of all food additives
								is more than 4.5. The "best" type of supplements are vitamins and fats, and the
								"worst" are greens & superfoods and amino acids. Acai berries, l-cysteine ​, and maca
								do not inspire consumer confidence despite their popularity. Zinc, selenium, vitamin D,
								and elderberry justify their popularity on the basis of the estimated effect. </p>

							<p class="fz-16">The bar chart is formed by a string field "Brand" on the X-axis
								and a numeric field "Frequency" along the Y-axis. The length of each column
								corresponds to the value of the quantity of dietary supplements produced under a
								particular brand. This chart is best for comparing values. Based on it, we can
								determine the top of the most popular brands.</p>
							<p class="fz-16">The data contains information about the brand name and the amount of
								nutritional supplements it produces. For the sake of clarity, the graph uses data
								corresponding to the filter "the number of produced dietary supplements is more
								than 50". The horizontal X-axis shows the brand name. The vertical y-axis shows the
								amount of supplements.</p>
							<p class="fz-16">The graph is interactive. To sort the bars in descending order, thereby
								easily identifying the top 3 popular brands, you need to click on the "Sort value"
								button. When you hover the mouse over a bar, the selected bar is highlighted and a
								tooltip is displayed with the brand name and the amount of supplements it produces.</p>
							<p class="fz-16">This graph helps to examine the production of large (number of dietary
								supplements > 50) supplement manufacturers. Most manufacturers have about 50-100
								positions of supplements presented on the site iHerb.com in the form of tablets
								and capsules. However, there are three brands (Now Foods, Source Naturals, Solgar)
								with more than 100 products in production. It is their products that we will analyze
								in more detail using other charts.</p>

								equal to 100%. This pie chart is ideal for quickly getting an idea of the proportional
								distribution of all types of nutritional supplements produced by top brands.</p>
							<p class="fz-16">The data contains information on the quantity of products for each type
								of nutritional supplement. Only those brands that were identified in the previous graph
								as the brands with the largest production (Now Foods, Source Naturals, Solgar) were
								used in the calculation.</p>
							<p class="fz-16">The graph is interactive. To see what percentage of each type of
								supplements is produced by a specific manufacturer, you need to select the required
								brand from the block located to the right of the graph.</p>
							<p class="fz-16">Several conclusions were drawn from this visualization. The production
								of vitamins, amino acids and minerals is most numerous for all brands. For each brand
								investigated, the greens & superfoods were the smallest in terms of production.
								Almost half of all Solgar production is made up of vitamins, which makes it more
								specialized in this type of dietary supplements. The distribution of supplements by
								type is almost the same for brands Now Foods and Source Naturals. To draw conclusions
								about the quality and price of the products of the top brands, refer to the following
								chart.</p>

							<p class="fz-16">In scatter plots, dots, arranged in a Cartesian coordinate system,

								axis, you can determine if there is a relationship or correlation
								between the two variables.</p>
							<p class="fz-16">The data contains information about the full name of supplements,
								its price, rating and manufacturer. The study involved only three brands identified
								as high-volume brands. The X-axis is the value of the price of supplements, and the
								Y-axis is the value of the rating. Each color and symbol serve as helping parameters
								for a more visual highlighting of belonging to a certain cluster, brand.</p>
							<p class="fz-16">The graph is interactive. When you hover the cursor over a point,
								the cluster of the current brand is highlighted, that is, all dietary supplements
								produced by this manufacturer. A tooltip also appears with the full name of the dietary
								supplement. Along with it, a pop-up inscription appears on the right with the name of
								the selected brand.</p>
							<p class="fz-16">The scatter plot showed zero correlation between price and rating for
								each brand under study. On average, Solgar turned out to be the best brand in the
								rating (the rating of most supplements is above 4.5). Solgar has few high-end products
								compared to its competitors. This may be due to the fact that Solgar produces less fat
								than others, which are considered expensive supplements (based on previous charts). The
								Source Naturals brand is inferior to its competitors in terms of product quality. The
								best products of the Solgar company are iron and omega-3, the Now Foods company -
								vitamins K, D and B-12, and the Source Naturals company - calcium.</p>
